# optical-character-analyser
Optical character analyser, which operates on scanned images

The very first objectives of this are following
- detecting text regions on scanend images
- detecting symbols on regions
- store symbols as graphs properly to accurately calculate topologycal invariants

code is very unorganized and messy, i will make it fancier once it achievs the goals above
